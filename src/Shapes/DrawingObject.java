	assigned to this course.

	We have not used Java language code obtained from another student, 
	or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.

	If any Java language code or documentation used in our program 
	was obtained from another source, such as a textbook or website, 
	that has been clearly noted with a proper citation in the comments 
	of our program.
