## _Foosball_: Game Manual

**Foosball** is a network game simulation of _table soccer_. It is played by controlling rods with miniature soccer players attached in order to “kick” the ball and hit the goal. The game can be played by 2 network players.

### Gameplay: 
Each player represents a team and controls the handles of the rods according to team color. The player that hits the ball into the opponent’s goal scores a point. The player that scores 5 wins the game.

### Controls: 
The ball is initially spawned with the **`[spacebar]`** by either of the players to start. The rods may then be controlled by the **`mouse wheel or scroll`** (primary) or the **`up & down keys`** (secondary). After each goal, the ball must be spawned again.

### Theme: 
This game presents a digital version of the foosball game board. It also incorporates an olympic theme and thus represents countries.
